        I'm an Internet web developer type person. I'm currently working at <a href="https://hnry.co.nz/">Hnry</a> and it's a fun adventure. Do you enjoy programming challenges then <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonwaghorn/">send me a message</a> - I really don't like LinkedIn but that seems to be where we talk about work stuff. Also see our <a href="https://on.hnry.co.nz/jobs">current job openings</a>, we always seem to be hiring and growing which is part fo the fun.
